## Tamil Nadu Weather Forecasting

Application Link: https://share.streamlit.io/anwarmohammedbasha/weather-forecast/main/app.py

A weather forecast is a prediction of how the weather will be the following day or the following several days. Based on input information such as city, date, and temperature, this application can forecast the weather for cities in Tamil Nadu for the next seven days.  

I've gathered the weather data for Tamil Nadu from [NASA Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/). I have data from January 2010 until the present. We directly import the data into **Github** to ensure that the data is updated.
