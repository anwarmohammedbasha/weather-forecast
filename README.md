# Tamil Nadu Weather Forecast

A weather forecast is a prediction of how the weather will be the following day or the following several days. Based on input information such as city, date, and temperature, this application can forecast the weather for cities in Tamil Nadu for the next seven days. We use ARIMA, a statistical analysis model, to foresee potential trends. The project's members are mentioned below.

### Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source python framework for building web apps for Machine Learning and Data Science. Streamlit allows you to write an app the same way you write a python code. Streamlit makes it seamless to work on the interactive loop of coding and viewing results in the web app.


### Data Collection

We gathered the weather data for Tamil Nadu with the help of WeatherAPI.com, a free weather API provider, and WayScript, a scripting platform. We have been gathering data since Arpil 2021. We directly import the data into github to ensure that the data is updated.
