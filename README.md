### Summary

A weather forecast is a prediction of how the weather will be the following day or the following several days. Based on input information such as city, date, and temperature, this application can forecast the weather for cities in Tamil Nadu for the next seven days.  

We gathered the weather data for Tamil Nadu with the help of WeatherAPI.com, a free weather API provider, and WayScript, a scripting platform. We have been gathering data since Arpil 2021. We directly import the data into github to ensure that the data is updated. We pre-processed the data with the help of pandas, a Python package, to make it suitable for modelling. We use ARIMA, a statistical analysis model, to foresee potential trends.  For modelling, we utilise the statsmodels package. Finally, we build web apps with Streamlit, a Python framework.
